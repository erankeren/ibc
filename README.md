This is a small project I did on my free time for IBC London.

I used this project to learn JS and python and some web site building.

Building blocks:

1. Client side - HTML/CSS/JS + Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/)

2. Server side - Python with pycherry as a web framework (http://www.cherrypy.org/)

3. Database - sqlite3 (https://www.sqlite.org/)
    ...As said it was a small project :-)...


Other things I've used:

1. AWS EC2 Instance - as the hosting server
2. AWS S3 - for storing images
3. AWS Route 53 - to register the domain name
4. CloudFront - as the ssl frontend
